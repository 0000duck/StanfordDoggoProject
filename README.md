# The Stanford Doggo Project
## Overview Of Stanford Doggo
Stanford Doggo is a highly agile robot designed to provide an accessible platform for legged robot research. Currently, the robot holds the record (among all robots) for greatest vertical jumping agility<sup>1</sup>. Stanford Doggo can also jump twice as high as any existing quadruped robot. Weighing in at a little less than 5kg, Stanford Doggo is easy and safe to develop on, but at the same time, Stanford Doggo should not be expected to carry heavy loads or climb extremely aggressive terrain. The project is supported by Stanford Student Robotics http://roboticsclub.stanford.edu/.

<sup>1</sup>[Vertical jumping agility] = [maximum vertical jump height] / [time from onset of actuation to apogee of jump]
